# Release 2.1.0-RC1

## Enhancements

* Upgraded 3rd party POM model processing libraries:
  - Maven: 3.0.5 to 3.3.9
  - Maven Wagon: 2.9 to 2.10
  - Aether: Sonatype 1.13.1 to Eclipse 1.0.2.v20150114

Because a number of internal Maven/Aether APIs are being used, some of these classes went away between releases, and had to be replaced with others. As such, significant testing is needed from non-trivial projects to ensure previous functionality remains intact. Bug reports are very much appreciated.
